# Add play button/action for built-in library items

When viewing a built-in item like 'Lofi Girl' YouTube stream in the detail view, there's no obvious way to play it. Users expect to see:
- A prominent play button
- Double-click to play
- Context menu with 'Play' option
- Or automatic playback when selecting the item

Currently the item detail view doesn't expose playback controls, making it confusing for users who want to start playback.
