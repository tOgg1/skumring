# Show playlist contents in list view instead of just item count

Currently playlists in the sidebar/list view only show the playlist name and item count (e.g., 'My Playlist (3)'). Should expand to show:
- Playlist name as a header/section
- List of items contained in the playlist with their titles and thumbnails
- Ability to play individual items or the whole playlist
- Visual indication of which item is currently playing if applicable

This improves discoverability and makes playlists more useful without having to click into them.
