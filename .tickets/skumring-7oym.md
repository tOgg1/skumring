# Add fullscreen mode for YouTube player

Add ability to enter fullscreen mode for the YouTube video player. Should support:
- A fullscreen button in the player controls or title bar
- Keyboard shortcut (e.g., F or Cmd+F)
- Double-click on video to toggle fullscreen
- Proper exit via Escape key
- Remember window state when exiting fullscreen

Consider using NSWindow's native fullscreen support or a custom overlay approach.
