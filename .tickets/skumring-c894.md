# Add empty-state Add Item CTA in LibraryView

In LibraryView empty states (all filters), add a prominent 'Add Item' button that opens AddItemSheet (same behavior as Cmd+L/File > Add Item). Include a short hint for the shortcut. Acceptance: button appears when filteredItems is empty, opens AddItemSheet, keyboard shortcut hint visible.
